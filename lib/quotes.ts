  "The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.",

  "It might seem that I am exaggerating, though no one with imagination and the slightest knowledge of irony could have failed to note the preposterous claims of progress and improvement. The fundamental basis of all assumptions in this matter is that the citizen will be benefited by developing and intensifying the life of the great towns. The assumption is false. Life in great towns is the very reverse of a natural and healthy condition of the human being.",

  "Nobody realizes that some people expend tremendous energy merely to be normal. In a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act. Happiness is not a goal; it is a by-product. Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony. The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.",

  "The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality.",

  "For a moment, nothing happened. Then, after a second or so, nothing continued to happen. The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't. The Guide is definitive. Reality is frequently inaccurate. In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.",

  "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife. However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.",

  "All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. He stepped down, trying not to look long at her, as if she were the sun, yet he saw her, like the sun, even without looking. If you look for perfection, you'll never be content. It's not all about love and happiness. Life is about getting through each day without too much pain.",

  "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way.",

  "In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since. 'Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,' he told me, 'just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.' He didn't say any more, but we've always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that.",

  "Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendia was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice. At that time Macondo was a village of twenty adobe houses, built on the bank of a river of clear water that ran along a bed of polished stones, which were white and enormous, like prehistoric eggs. The world was so recent that many things lacked names, and in order to indicate them it was necessary to point.",
